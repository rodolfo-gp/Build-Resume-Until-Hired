# SENG401-Term-Project

## For the developers:

1. For the backend, start by creating a conda environment. Something like this should suffice:
```
conda create --name SENG401FinalProject python==3.10
```
2. This will create a new environment that will run the backend. It includes the python install, as well as pip.
3. To install all of the dependencies, navigate to the root directory of "seng41-term-project", wherever it is on your machine.
Once you are there, you can activate your newly created environment by running:
```
conda activate SENG401FinalProject 
```
From here, you can run this one too:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. From here, you can run the python file without any issues (except for the GPT key, which will be in the env file sent to everyone)
